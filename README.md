 ## Summary Report of all Sections
District ABC is a school district with a total of 15 schools, home to a student body of 39,170 students and a total district budget of $24.6 million dollars. 

The average math score is 79% (seventy-five percent of the student body passing). The average reading score is 82% (eighty-five percent of the student body passing). Across all 15 schools, sixty-five percent of the grades were passing. 

Out of the 15 schools, 7 of them are public district schools and the rest charter schools.

The analysis performed within this report intends to breakdown the grade percentages by the following: 

>  By district
>  By school grades (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)
>  By per student budget 
>  By school size
>  By school type (Charter or District)

 ## Conclusions & Comaprisons

##### Observation 1:
> It might be problematic to conclude that more or less spending has a definitive correlation on the scores for specific subject areas.

Across ABC's 15 schools,  the only trendline that can be observed is that the more expenditure per student, the signficantly lower the average score and passing **math grades** are, as well as the overall passing grade percentage. 

As the baseline commments mentioned, it could be due to smaller class sizes, but it could also be due to demographic and/or socioeconomic factors that are not considered in this dataset. For example, housing vulnerablility, nutrition, among other factors.

Although one could conclude that Charter Schools outperforms District Schools, one could argue that it is *mostly* true for the subject of Math, not reading. Charter Schools average and mantain a constant B- across the highschool years, while District Schools showcase a C and/or C+ through the same grade levels. 

##### Observation 2: 
> There seems to be a the sweet spot for school student count size and the overall passing grade percentage

The best ranked District school sits as the mode between all 15 District's ABC schools. The delta between the overall passing average percentage is the interesting data point. 

At rank 8/15, Bailey Highschool is a district school with 4976 students, and a passing rate of 54.6%. ($628 per student)

At rank 7/15, Holden Highschool is a charter school with 427 students, and a passing rate of 89.2% ($581 per student)

This large gap between district and charter (D- / B+) begs to consider that there might be a overall passing grade weight to be considered depending on the size of the class. 

Similar to the building to land or Floor to Area Ratio (FAR), there might be somehting similar to be considered for schools when it comes to comparing grades - similar to a grading scale.
